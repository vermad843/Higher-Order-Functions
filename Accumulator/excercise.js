/*
The Accumulator Pattern 

A common programming "pattern" is to iterate over
an array,accumulating a value as we go. This pattern
is commonly used to sum the numbers in an array,
or to build a new array based on existing array.

 3 parts of the accumulator pattern: 

1. initialize an 'accumulator' variable to an initial
   value
2. iterating over an array
3. updating the accumulator variable on each iteration
